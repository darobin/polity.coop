TECH:
	- switch to using Narwhal as it's far more CommonJS compliant, which we'll need to avoid any number
	  of bugs. We can still use narwharl-node to run atop Node, but we'll stick to this.
	- make sure that Nodule is switched over simultaneously, see if it can run something that isn't Node.
	  Failing that, revive the dependency downloader.
	- Forget Pintura completely, switch to pure JSGI (over Jack) and reuse the Facets from Perstore where needed.
	  This might justify starting from scratch: we can move the old stuff around in git and start over.

THOUGHTS:
	- look into reusing code from node-paperboy for static serving instead of rolling more or less our own
