	- all documents have comma tools
		. ,versions (Atom available)
		. ,version=n
		
	- all chats have logs

	- all spaces have an /api/ that is where Pintura is addressed

	- Is it possible to override the default User class by defining it? Or maybe by touching security.js's
	  exports.userSchema

	- don't use Pintura, use components from it (and more generally, Perstore) because some parts are really
	  too flaky, and it doesn't do much of what we actually need
